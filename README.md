# SQL Query App

## Project Overview
The project is a SQL query application that enables users to interact with CSV files. It offers a default CSV file and the option for users to upload their own CSV files for querying. 

Users can perform various queries, including finding values for each column. Additionally, a default query option is available in a dropdown menu, allowing users to select queries and view results. The application provides statistical insights like mean, mode, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and count for the data. Users can also visualize the data through bar charts. 

Moreover, the application supports importing external APIs, enabling users to query and work with data from external sources.
